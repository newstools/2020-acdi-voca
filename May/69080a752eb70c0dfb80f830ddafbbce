Our USAID Honduras Transforming Market Systems (TMS) Activity has joined private- and public-sectors actors to form the National Tourism Table. The table will support and help revive the Honduran tourism industry in the face of the COVID-19 crisis. TMS is part of this effort in part due to its recent survey of the impact of COVID-19 on Honduran businesses.



The director of TMS’s tourism component will serve on the table, which also includes representatives from hotels, airlines, car rental companies, tourism operators, and specific tourism destinations in Honduras. The table is co-chaired by the Minister of Tourism and the President of the National Chamber of Tourism of Honduras. 



The table’s activities include the establishment of a fund to support tourism-sector employees–some 250,000 individuals–financially and with online training as they weather this crisis. The table will also support efforts to modernize Honduras’s tourism industry, with a move toward e-commerce. Financial systems will be updated among other improvements as the table plans for the next phase of the tourism sector’s recovery.
