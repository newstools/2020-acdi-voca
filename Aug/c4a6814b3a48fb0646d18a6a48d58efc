For today’s International Youth Day 2020, we’re please to share a video from our USAID Feed the Future Tanzania NAFAKA II Activity, which has helped build the capacity of the Azimio Youth Group in Iringa, Tanzania. The group received a grant, through which it acquired COVID-19 safety equipment such as masks, hand sanitizer, soap, and gloves. Another grant enabled the group to access a power tiller and spray services, through which it has increased agricultural yields, productivity, and incomes. Learn more about the group’s recent successes in a video below.
